          <blockquote>“Oktoberfest is celebrated all over the world, like St. Patrick’s Day,” said Roy Pogorzelski, who is organizing the event with his brother John.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>“ This year there are twice as many Pogo Brothers, we’re both MCing this year,” added John Pogorzelski, noting he has usually taken care of the logistical side of organizing this massive event while his brother has handled organizing the entertainment.</blockquote>

          <p>The event  has been very popular since it’s beginning. “Last year we had 4 or 5,000 people filtering in and out of here last year. They drank us out of beer last time, but that’s not going to happen this year, we bought a lot more beer this year,” Roy Pogorzelski said.</p>
          <blockquote> Oktoberfest continues to expand. “This year we‘re hoping for 6 or 8,000 people. We’re hopeful mother Bavaria looks favourably upon us and gives us good weather,” he said.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>“We started in Festival square, but moved it to Galt Gardens so more people could come,” Roy Pogorzelski said, adding improvements this year include ATMs and more bathroom access on site this year as well.</blockquote>
          <blockquote>“We also have a family area this year, because we had people asking for one, so there will be face painting and games until a reasonable hour like 8 p.m.,” he continued.</blockquote>
          <p>Oktoberfest runs from 11 a.m.-11 p.m. on Sept. 29 and 30.</p>
          <blockquote>“We couldn’t do this without our generous sponsors,” he said</blockquote>

          <blockquote>If you can’t go to Munich, then maybe you can go to Oktoberfest here,” he continued</blockquote>

          <p>After checking out  the ArtWalk and getting your passport stamped through "Stomp N’ Stamp” and entering your name into a draw for an original painting by local artist Aaron Hagan, stop by Galt Gardens, Sept. 29 and 30 for a beer and German themed fun with Oktoberfest
